## Schedule

**Introduction** *\~30 minutes*

**Systems check** *\~15 minutes*

**Play** *\~30 minutes*

**Wrap Up and Discussion** *\~20 minutes*

## What is R?

It's a programming language.

It's software.

It's free!

## Why is R amazing?

You can run it locally.

You can run it in the cloud.

You can run it on a high performance computing cluster!

There's a great community around the world using R!!

## Why should you add R to your workflow

You can reproduce your work.

You can share every step of your analysis.

You can reuse your code for many projects!

You can use **other's** code for many projects!

## What does R look like

```{r peek_r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

# Text after a hash is a comment
# It is not run by the computer 
# Can be used as notes to you (or future you!)

# Here are a few simple calculations
1 + 1

2 * 3

4^2

```

## Text

You can manipulate strings of text.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
host <- "Mara"

greeting <- "Hello World"
  
paste0(greeting, " from ", host, "!")
```


## You can import data easily

- Excel

- Google Sheets

- SAS

- SPSS

- Stata

- Lot's more

## Here's some data in Excel

You might have data like this?

How do you get it into R?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/excel_data.png")
```


## Data Import Examples

Like this!


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#From Excel

fake_data <- 
  read_excel("./data/qi_spreadsheet_workshop.xlsx", 
    sheet = "scatter")

```

## Tables

You can make tables from your data.
```{r fd_table1, echo = FALSE}

head(fake_data, 5) %>%
  kable(caption = "Recreating booktabs style table", format = "latex", booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
## Tables, behind the curtains

How did I make that table?? 
```{r fd_table2, echo = TRUE}

head(fake_data, 5) %>%
  kable(caption = "Recreating booktabs style table", 
        format = "latex", 
        booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```


## Plots, simple

You can make plots. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fake_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = time)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Plots, statistics

You can make plots---with statistical overlay. 

```{r stats_plot, echo= FALSE, warning=FALSE}


df <- data.frame(x = c(1:100))
df$y <- 2 + 3 * df$x + rnorm(100, sd = 40)
my.formula <- y ~ x
p <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="black", formula = my.formula) +
   stat_poly_eq(formula = my.formula, 
                aes(label = paste(..eq.label.., ..rr.label.., sep = "~~~")), 
                parse = TRUE) +         
   geom_point() +
   theme_minimal() +
   labs(x = "A great X axis", y = "A lovely Y axis", title = "What a graph!?!", subtitle = "Really swell", caption = "This data is simulated")
p
   
```

## Plots, fancier

```{r data_histogram, echo=FALSE}
# This is where the data is generated
pre_cards <- tibble(days = round(runif(100, 0, 21)), intervention = "Before Intervention", clinic = "Cardiology Clinic")
post_cards <- tibble(days = round(runif(100, 0, 14)), intervention = "After Intervention", clinic = "Cardiology Clinic")
pre_gi <- tibble(days = round(runif(100, 0, 20)), intervention = "Before Intervention", clinic = "Endocrinology Clinic")
post_gi <- tibble(days = round(runif(100, 0, 15)), intervention = "After Intervention", clinic = "Endocrinology Clinic")

data_histo <- bind_rows(pre_cards, post_cards, pre_gi, post_gi)

data_histo$intervention <- as_factor(data_histo$intervention)
data_histo$clinic <- as_factor(data_histo$clinic)

```

```{r plot_histo}
plot_data_histo <-  ggplot(data_histo, aes(days, fill = clinic)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = 'white') +
  labs(title = "Days between date of encounter and note signed", 
       subtitle = "Adult Patients at XYZ Campus", 
       y = "Number of Notes", 
       x = "Days", caption="Simulated Data") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,4,8,12,16, 20, 24)) +
  facet_grid(intervention ~ clinic) +
  scale_color_npg(palette = 	"nrc")+
  scale_fill_npg(palette = 	"nrc") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(text=element_text(family="serif"))

plot_data_histo
```

## Plots, interactive

Not interactive here because this is a PDF! But here's a picture. The code to transform the plot is a sinlge function `ggplotly()`!
```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), echo=FALSE}
ggplotly(plot_data_histo)
```
```{r pic_interactive_plot, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), echo=FALSE}

pdf_text <- "Not interactive here because this is a PDF! But here's a picture. The code to transform the plot is a sinlge function `ggplotly()`!"
  
knitr::include_graphics("./images/interactive_plot.png")
```


## Code + Text + Figures

::: columns

:::: column
With R you can create documents in different formats:

- Word
- PDF
- Slides
- Websites
- Blogs
- Books
- PNG/JPEG
- And more!!
::::

:::: column


```{r your-chunk-name, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Book Made with R"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/example_bookdown.png")

#The figure will appear on the right side of the slide...
```
::::

:::


## Other amazing things

You can mix programming languages together

- R and Python

- R and Python and SQL

- R and Python and SQL and Bash

- ...

## R is flexible!

- You use R from start to finish with a project

- You can use it for a single part of your project---eg making plots.

- You can use it alongside other software like Tableau and REDCap


## People know R, or want to!

- You could hire someone to do R work for you in a day.

- You probably already have folks at your institution who are R pros!

- People can upskill and learn R!

# Your turn now!

## Systems Check

- Log into Rstudio Cloud

- If you don't have a link to the materials, message Mara directly in the Zoom chat with your email

- Raise hand in zoom if you are having trouble

- Take this [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwsInqQ5NzJKxhM73rjXHM4stbIw-buBH21cKGniNjkUJ6bg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

- If you are an advanced user, open up the `QI_playground.Rmd` and start playing around

## Open up the project

Once you are in RStudio Cloud, click on the project called CIC_2021_QI_R_Workshop

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/rstudio_cloud_project.png")
```


## RStudio Cloud

For this workshop we will be using RStudio Cloud.

Why? Because there is nothing that you need to download!

You don't **need** to use RStudio to use R, but I do!

RStudio on your computer and RStudio Cloud look very similar.

R and RStudio are free to download to your computer. 

## RStudio Orientation: Basics

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/four_panes.png")
```

## RStudio Orientation: Knit

To knit something in R means to transform it from the raw text and code into a nice output like a PDF or slides. One source material can be knit into many different outputs---from the same source I might make a website, a word document, or a set of slides.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/knit.png")
```

## RStudio Orientation: Create a New File

Click there to make a new file. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/new_file.png")
```

## RStudio Orientation: Select R Markdown

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/make_new_R_Markdown.png")
```

## Make an R Markdown Document!!
 
After you have selected R Markdown, you will get a pop up like below.

Title it Hello World! Hit "OK"

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/untitled_r_markdown.png")
```

## View the Rmd

Your new file should look something like this.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/three_components_of_rmd.png")
```

## Rmd--What does it all mean?!?

An Rmd file allows you to mix code and text in a single document.  

You can then knit an Rmd file to many different outputs. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/knit_outputs.png")
```


## YAML

The YAML header contains the special instructions on how to create the output document. We won't do much with it here today, but it is a very powerful way to make your Rmd file as bespoke as you want it!

## Code Chunks

Code chunks are where the code will go. 

Code chunks have a gray background. 


```{r code_chunk, echo=TRUE}
#This is a code chunk!
#Here is a simple calculation
1 + 2

```
You can run a code chunk by pressing the green play button.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/code_chunk.png")
```


## Text

The text areas are the white background areas below the YAML header.

You can use R Markdown syntax to generate rich text formating from simple symbols like the examples below. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/rmarkdown_syntax.png")
```

## Knit that R Markdown Document!!

Press the knit button.

You'll be asked to save the file; name it `hello_world`

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/knit.png")
```

## View your output

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/hello_world_rmd.png")
```

# Congratulations!

## Let's start the Demo

Go to your file pane. Open the Demo.Rmd file.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/demo_rmd.png")
```


# Play!

## Live Demo

During the workshop we will work through the Demo.Rmd. 

Ask questions in the Zoom chat or raise your hand.^[Your Zoom hand!]

## Finally, the QI!

After finishing up the Demo.Rmd, we will move on to the QI part.  
Finally!

# Open the QI_playground.Rmd file
